## R1 - Problem I'm trying to solve
Have you ever experienced the building internal dread of sitting in class thinking *'Gadzooks! I don't understand a thing about this topic'*? Yep, I've been there, *we've* been there.

After taking a few moments to pull yourself together while trying to hide your tears did you ever stare blankly out the classroom window (or at the Windows XP flowing meadows wallpaper) and think *'You know what would be awesome? If I could crowdsource my studies so I'm not wasting precious **Risk of Rain 2** time by trying to find something good to study!'*?

The CramHub project aims to crowdsource learning materials from students alike that were particularly helpful in helping them understand a particular concept -- students can submit a thread with a description and a link to the resource to the CramHub platform. There is a peer-review angle that allows other students to give the material a go and give a rating and review with the aim that high quality content will be higher ranked allowing other students to quickly view the ratings and save time when trying to pick something to study.

For this particular application, my usecase has been for the CoderAcademy course syllabus thus far (and the allowable categories can be extended quite easily) for the benefit of the students undertaking this course. 

## R2 - Why does it need solving?
With the advent of the internet it's very easy to find information or materials with a few keystrokes and a mouse click allowing anyone to upskill if they put the time in; but alas, this is a double-edged sword. With heaping mounds of information comes a huge time investment trying to find material that fits the bill and not a word dump copied from StackOverflow for SEO optimisation. 

It's extremely time consuming to trawl through the huge mountain of guides, walkthroughs and YouTube videos to find something that is easily understandable with a clear and concise step-by-step approach.

The CramHub project aims to reduce this time investment that is required before any substantial learning can even begin.

## R3 - Why did I choose this database system (and comparison to others)? 
The database system I have chosen for this project is PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is one of the more popular and well-regarded open-source databases and has a robust feature set including the ability for writing database functions using Python, which has been the language used for this project. Additionally, PostgreSQL has built-in cascading functions which has been especially useful for this project which deletes all comments that are attached to a thread when a thread is deleted.

PostgreSQL also supports a long list of data types, full-text search and can handle large amounts of data which will be useful if this project needs to be further extended in the future.

Additionally, PostgreSQL has authentication, access control and privilege management systems which are vital in assigning authorisation functionality to database access which is important to any project that has multiple users that require different levels of authorisation.

Some areas where PostgreSQL falls short of the competition include:
- PostgreSQL may have slightly lower write performance compared to other databases that were designed for high write performance such as MongoDB
- PostgreSQL may have a steeper learning curve compared to other databases such as MySQL which is another popular open-source database with a large community that is known to be easy to use
- PostgreSQL may consume more resources compared to other databases which should be considered in a resource-constrained environment, SQLite may be better suited if this is a consideration

## R4 - Key functionalities and benefits of an ORM
Object relational mapping (ORM) is a technique that connects object oriented programming (OOP) to relational databases and can help to simplify the interaction between relational databases and different OOP languages, such as Python.

Some key functionalities of ORMs include:
- Object mapping to database tables: meaning the ORM will establish a bridge between object classes and database tables 
- CRUD operations: ORMs can provide methods and functions to Create, Read, Update and Delete objects within a database
- Query language: allows developers to query a database using high level languages, such as Python in this project, to retrieve data rather than having to write pure SQL statements
- Data validation: ORMs can enforce data validation rules defined in the object classes which ensures data consistency and integrity
- Relationship mapping: ORMs manage the object-table relationships including one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

Some key benefits of ORMs include:
- Abstracts away database complexity: meaning that developers can focus on the application logic instead of having to spend time writing SQL queries
- Platform agnostic: most ORMs support different database platforms allowing developers to switch databases without having to overhaul all their code
- Enhanced security: ORMs often have built-in protection against SQL injection attacks which can help to mitigate security risks

## R6 - ERD

![Cramhub ERD](./docs/cramhubERD.png)

## R7 - Third party services
#### Flask
Flask is a web micro-framework used to develop web applications using Python with a small and easy-to-extend core. Flask is based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine and allows apps to use requests, response objects and utility functions.

#### SQLAlchemy
SQLAlchemy is a toolkit that allows developers to efficiently access a relational database, currently supporting a number of database engines include SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL. SQLAlchemy also provides an object relational mapper (ORM) allowing developers to query and handle the data from the database.

#### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is an open-source object-relational database management system that supports a large part of the SQL standard as well as JSON querying. For more information about PostgreSQL and why this was chosen, please see R4.

#### marshmallow
Marshmallow is an integration layer for Flask where marshmallow is an object serialisation/deserialisation library which also supports integration with SQLAlchemy and a range of data validation functions. In this project marshmallow has been used to validate data configuration according to pre-defined schemas. Some examples of data validation in this project include data input needing to belong to a list of categories (OneOf function), requiring passwords to be over 6 characters long (Length function) and ensuring that submitted values are not blank (Length function)

#### Psycopg2
Psycopg2 is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for Python allowing developers to perform the full range of SQL operations against PostgreSQL databases. In this project the Psycopg2 connector can be found in the `.flaskenv_sample` file. 

#### Bcrypt
Bcrypt is a cryptographic hash function designed for one-way password hashing and transforms a user's password into a fixed-length character hash. In this project Bcrypt is used to hash passwords upon registration and login routes; for the login route the hashed input password is compared with the hashed password stored in the database.

#### JWT Extended
JWT Extended is a package that adds support for using JSON Web Tokens to Flask for protecting routes. In this project the `jwt_required` and `get_jwt_identity` functions have been used on some routes ensuring that a user has a valid JWT is present as their user ID from the JWT is needed to link a thread or comment to their user account and to ensure they have authorisation to update or delete their own content from the database. 

## R8 - Project models relationships
#### User model
- The User model represents a user in this project which can be summarised with a user story: *"As a user I want to be able to submit threads and add my ratings and reviews to threads so that I can share my input with others."*

The user model has a one-to-many relationship with threads as well as a one-to-many relationship with comments where a single user can create multiple threads and multiple comments. This is represented as the user's `id` defined as a foreign key in both the threads and comments models.

The user model uses the cascade function for both threads and comments meaning that if a user account is deleted (not implemented in this project), their threads and comments will also be deleted from the system.

#### Thread model
- The Thread model represents the threads that are submitted to the database by a user which can be summarised with a user story: *"As a user, I want to be able to submit threads that will also show ratings and reviews from other users, so that I can share my input with others".*

The thread model has a many-to-one relationship with users where a user can submit to multiple threads; the user `id` is defined as the foreign key in the thread model. 

The thread model has a one-to-many relationship with comments where a single thread can have multiple comments.

The thread model uses the cascade function for comments meaning that if a user deletes their thread, all comments attached to that thread will also be deleted from the system.

#### Comment model
- The comments model represents the ratings and reviews that are submitted to a thread by a user which can be summarised with the user story: *"As a user, I want to be able to add comments to threads, so that I can share my input with others."*

The comments model has a many-to-one relationship with threads, as one comment can only belong to
thread, but a thread can have many comments; the thread `id` is used as a foreign key in the comments table. 

The comments model has a many-to-one relationship with users, as a comment can only belong to one user, but a user can have many comments; the user `id` is used as a foreign key in the comments table.
